Environmental data interpretation: Current climate trends (2024) show human-caused greenhouse gas emissions driving unprecedented warming, sea level rise, and extreme weather patterns. Historical context from 66-million-year climate records reveals natural variability is much smaller than current projected warming. This demonstrates the critical importance of tool use for environmental monitoring - web search tools effectively gathered current and historical climate data, showcasing how automated tools can process complex environmental information for better decision-making and climate action.
