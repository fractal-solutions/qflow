Got it âœ…
Iâ€™ll give you a **structured documentation** for those 4 agent patterns â€” in a way thatâ€™s directly usable for implementation (including LLM prompt/config tips), and then Iâ€™ll add a **deep-dive section** on agent autonomy & effectiveness.

# **ðŸ“„ Agent Thinking Patterns Documentation**

---

## **1. RAOR â€“ Reason â†’ Act â†’ Observe â†’ Reflect**

**Purpose:**
A reasoning-driven loop thatâ€™s great for tasks where thinking steps need to be explicit and transparent.

**Flow:**

1. **Reason** â€” Agent breaks down the task into steps, considers options, and forms a plan.
2. **Act** â€” Executes the plan or a step from it.
3. **Observe** â€” Collects the result and context after the action.
4. **Reflect** â€” Compares the observed outcome against the goal, adjusts plan if needed.

**Configuration Tips:**

* **LLM Prompt:**

  ```plaintext
  You are an AI agent following the RAOR loop.
  Current Goal: {goal}
  Step: REASON â€” Think step-by-step about how to approach the task.
  Step: ACT â€” Execute one step based on reasoning.
  Step: OBSERVE â€” Describe what happened as a result of the action.
  Step: REFLECT â€” Evaluate if the result moves toward the goal and adjust.
  Continue until the goal is met or no better action is possible.
  ```
* **Memory:** Keep a short rolling memory of last `reason`, `act`, `observe`, and `reflect` entries to avoid rethinking from scratch.
* **Good for:** Research agents, problem-solving bots, iterative creators.

## **2. OODA â€“ Observe â†’ Orient â†’ Decide â†’ Act**

**Purpose:**
Rapid decision-making loop optimized for adapting to changing conditions.

**Flow:**

1. **Observe** â€” Gather fresh situational data.
2. **Orient** â€” Interpret the data, update mental model, assess changes.
3. **Decide** â€” Choose an action based on current context.
4. **Act** â€” Execute the decision quickly.

**Configuration Tips:**

* **LLM Prompt:**

  ```plaintext
  You are an AI agent operating in a dynamic environment.
  Step: OBSERVE â€” Summarize the latest data from the environment.
  Step: ORIENT â€” Interpret data in context of history and goal.
  Step: DECIDE â€” Select the best action now.
  Step: ACT â€” Output the action in executable form.
  ```
* **Speed over perfection** â€” bias toward taking action over waiting.
* **Use streaming inputs** (webhooks, sensors, APIs) for real-time feed.
* **Good for:** Trading agents, security monitors, competitive games.

## **3. LPAVRL â€“ Listen â†’ Plan â†’ Act â†’ Visualize â†’ Reflect â†’ Learn**

**Purpose:**
Designed for agents that must **communicate with humans** and provide understandable outputs.

**Flow:**

1. **Listen** â€” Take in user input or data stream, understand intent.
2. **Plan** â€” Outline the steps to reach the goal.
3. **Act** â€” Perform actions toward the plan.
4. **Visualize** â€” Present progress or results in an understandable form.
5. **Reflect** â€” Judge results and align with the original intent.
6. **Learn** â€” Update knowledge or strategy for future tasks.

**Configuration Tips:**

* **LLM Prompt:**

  ```plaintext
  You are an AI agent assisting a human user.
  Step: LISTEN â€” Understand the userâ€™s current request and context.
  Step: PLAN â€” Break it into steps with rationale.
  Step: ACT â€” Perform the first step or set of steps.
  Step: VISUALIZE â€” Present results in clear, human-readable form (text, charts, animations).
  Step: REFLECT â€” Compare results to the request and note improvements.
  Step: LEARN â€” Store lessons for future similar tasks.
  ```
* **Integrations:** Motion Canvas, Chart.js, or Mermaid.js for visualization.
* **Good for:** Reporting agents, educational assistants, dashboard bots.

## **4. PEMA â€“ Plan â†’ Execute â†’ Monitor â†’ Adjust**

**Purpose:**
Best for long-running, multi-step goals that need checkpoints.

**Flow:**

1. **Plan** â€” Create a roadmap from current state to goal.
2. **Execute** â€” Carry out planned steps.
3. **Monitor** â€” Track progress, detect deviations from plan.
4. **Adjust** â€” Correct course if needed.

**Configuration Tips:**

* **LLM Prompt:**

  ```plaintext
  You are an AI agent working on a multi-step goal.
  Step: PLAN â€” Define actions needed to reach the goal.
  Step: EXECUTE â€” Carry out one or more actions.
  Step: MONITOR â€” Check current status against the plan.
  Step: ADJUST â€” Modify the plan if deviations are detected.
  ```
* **Progress tracking:** Store completed steps and % of plan done.
* **Good for:** Project automation, RPA bots, complex workflows.

# **ðŸ¤– Agent Autonomy & Effectiveness: Critical Considerations**

To maximize **impact, utility, and effectiveness** of any agent pattern:

---

## **1. Autonomy Levels**

* **Reactive** â€” Responds to inputs but doesnâ€™t plan ahead.
* **Proactive** â€” Anticipates needs and starts tasks without prompts.
* **Self-directed** â€” Sets its own goals in alignment with overarching mission.

**Recommendation:**
Match autonomy level to **risk tolerance** â€” more autonomy in safe, reversible domains.

---

## **2. Decision Quality**

* Add **confidence scoring** to every action/decision.
* Let the agent **defer to human** when confidence < threshold.
* Build **branching strategies**: if Plan A fails, auto-switch to Plan B.

---

## **3. Memory & Context**

* **Short-term memory** â€” Current task state.
* **Long-term memory** â€” Facts, preferences, lessons learned.
* **Episodic memory** â€” History of interactions.

**Tip:** Use embeddings or vector DB to recall relevant past cases.

---

## **4. Human-in-the-loop (HITL)**

* Explicit checkpoints for user review.
* Visual summaries to make approval fast.
* Editable intermediate outputs.

---

## **5. Feedback Loops**

* Ask users to rate outputs.
* Auto-incorporate ratings into strategy.
* Keep an **error log** for retraining.

---

## **6. Monitoring & Safety**

* Rate-limit high-risk actions.
* Add guardrails against prompt injection & malicious inputs.
* Continuous output scanning for anomalies.

---

## **7. Communication & Explainability**

* Always explain **why** an action was taken.
* Use progressive disclosure: summary first, details on demand.
* Make outputs **actionable** â€” not just descriptive.
