---

## **1. RAOR – Reason → Act → Observe → Reflect**

**Purpose:**
A reasoning-driven loop that’s great for tasks where thinking steps need to be explicit and transparent.

**Flow:**

1. **Reason** — Agent breaks down the task into steps, considers options, and forms a plan.
2. **Act** — Executes the plan or a step from it.
3. **Observe** — Collects the result and context after the action.
4. **Reflect** — Compares the observed outcome against the goal, adjusts plan if needed.

**Configuration Tips:**

* **LLM Prompt:**

  ```plaintext
  You are an AI agent following the RAOR loop.
  Current Goal: {goal}
  Step: REASON — Think step-by-step about how to approach the task.
  Step: ACT — Execute one step based on reasoning.
  Step: OBSERVE — Describe what happened as a result of the action.
  Step: REFLECT — Evaluate if the result moves toward the goal and adjust.
  Continue until the goal is met or no better action is possible.
  ```
* **Memory:** Keep a short rolling memory of last `reason`, `act`, `observe`, and `reflect` entries to avoid rethinking from scratch.
* **Good for:** Research agents, problem-solving bots, iterative creators.

## **2. OODA – Observe → Orient → Decide → Act**

**Purpose:**
Rapid decision-making loop optimized for adapting to changing conditions.

**Flow:**

1. **Observe** — Gather fresh situational data.
2. **Orient** — Interpret the data, update mental model, assess changes.
3. **Decide** — Choose an action based on current context.
4. **Act** — Execute the decision quickly.

**Configuration Tips:**

* **LLM Prompt:**

  ```plaintext
  You are an AI agent operating in a dynamic environment.
  Step: OBSERVE — Summarize the latest data from the environment.
  Step: ORIENT — Interpret data in context of history and goal.
  Step: DECIDE — Select the best action now.
  Step: ACT — Output the action in executable form.
  ```
* **Speed over perfection** — bias toward taking action over waiting.
* **Use streaming inputs** (webhooks, sensors, APIs) for real-time feed.
* **Good for:** Trading agents, security monitors, competitive games.

## **3. LPAVRL – Listen → Plan → Act → Visualize → Reflect → Learn**

**Purpose:**
Designed for agents that must **communicate with humans** and provide understandable outputs.

**Flow:**

1. **Listen** — Take in user input or data stream, understand intent.
2. **Plan** — Outline the steps to reach the goal.
3. **Act** — Perform actions toward the plan.
4. **Visualize** — Present progress or results in an understandable form.
5. **Reflect** — Judge results and align with the original intent.
6. **Learn** — Update knowledge or strategy for future tasks.

**Configuration Tips:**

* **LLM Prompt:**

  ```plaintext
  You are an AI agent assisting a human user.
  Step: LISTEN — Understand the user’s current request and context.
  Step: PLAN — Break it into steps with rationale.
  Step: ACT — Perform the first step or set of steps.
  Step: VISUALIZE — Present results in clear, human-readable form (text, charts, animations).
  Step: REFLECT — Compare results to the request and note improvements.
  Step: LEARN — Store lessons for future similar tasks.
  ```
* **Integrations:** Motion Canvas, Chart.js, or Mermaid.js for visualization.
* **Good for:** Reporting agents, educational assistants, dashboard bots.

## **4. PEMA – Plan → Execute → Monitor → Adjust**

**Purpose:**
Best for long-running, multi-step goals that need checkpoints.

**Flow:**

1. **Plan** — Create a roadmap from current state to goal.
2. **Execute** — Carry out planned steps.
3. **Monitor** — Track progress, detect deviations from plan.
4. **Adjust** — Correct course if needed.

**Configuration Tips:**

* **LLM Prompt:**

  ```plaintext
  You are an AI agent working on a multi-step goal.
  Step: PLAN — Define actions needed to reach the goal.
  Step: EXECUTE — Carry out one or more actions.
  Step: MONITOR — Check current status against the plan.
  Step: ADJUST — Modify the plan if deviations are detected.
  ```
* **Progress tracking:** Store completed steps and % of plan done.
* **Good for:** Project automation, RPA bots, complex workflows.

# **🤖 Agent Autonomy & Effectiveness: Critical Considerations**

To maximize **impact, utility, and effectiveness** of any agent pattern:

---

## **1. Autonomy Levels**

* **Reactive** — Responds to inputs but doesn’t plan ahead.
* **Proactive** — Anticipates needs and starts tasks without prompts.
* **Self-directed** — Sets its own goals in alignment with overarching mission.

**Recommendation:**
Match autonomy level to **risk tolerance** — more autonomy in safe, reversible domains.

---

## **2. Decision Quality**

* Add **confidence scoring** to every action/decision.
* Let the agent **defer to human** when confidence < threshold.
* Build **branching strategies**: if Plan A fails, auto-switch to Plan B.

---

## **3. Memory & Context**

* **Short-term memory** — Current task state.
* **Long-term memory** — Facts, preferences, lessons learned.
* **Episodic memory** — History of interactions.

**Tip:** Use embeddings or vector DB to recall relevant past cases.

---

## **4. Human-in-the-loop (HITL)**

* Explicit checkpoints for user review.
* Visual summaries to make approval fast.
* Editable intermediate outputs.

---

## **5. Feedback Loops**

* Ask users to rate outputs.
* Auto-incorporate ratings into strategy.
* Keep an **error log** for retraining.

---

## **6. Monitoring & Safety**

* Rate-limit high-risk actions.
* Add guardrails against prompt injection & malicious inputs.
* Continuous output scanning for anomalies.

---

## **7. Communication & Explainability**

* Always explain **why** an action was taken.
* Use progressive disclosure: summary first, details on demand.
* Make outputs **actionable** — not just descriptive.
