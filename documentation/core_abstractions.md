## Core Abstractions

`qflow` is built around a few core abstractions that enable powerful and flexible workflow definitions.

### Shared State (`shared` object)

A central, mutable JavaScript object that is passed through the entire flow. Nodes can read from and write to this `shared` object, making it the primary mechanism for passing data and context between different nodes in a workflow. This is particularly useful for accumulating results or maintaining state across multiple steps.

### Node

The fundamental building block of any `qflow` workflow. A `Node` represents a single, atomic operation or step in your flow.

*   `prep(shared)`: Prepares data for execution. Receives the `shared` object.
*   `exec(prepRes)`: Executes the node's primary logic.
*   `post(shared, prepRes, execRes)`: Processes the result of `exec`. Receives the `shared` object.
*   `setParams(params)`: Configures the node with specific parameters. Parameters are accessible via `this.params`.
*   `next(node, action = "default")`: Chains this node to another, defining the next step in the flow.

**Asynchronous Nodes (`AsyncNode`, `AsyncBatchNode`, `AsyncParallelBatchNode`)**
For operations that involve I/O or are inherently asynchronous, `qflow` provides `AsyncNode` and its variants. These nodes leverage `async`/`await` for non-blocking execution. When working within `AsyncFlow`s, it's crucial to implement the `async` versions of the lifecycle methods:
*   `prepAsync(shared)`
*   `execAsync(prepRes, shared)`
*   `postAsync(shared, prepRes, execRes)`
*   `preparePrompt(shared)` (specifically for LLM nodes, allowing prompt construction based on `shared` state)

These `async` methods ensure proper awaiting and data propagation within asynchronous workflows.

### Flow

A `Flow` orchestrates the execution of a sequence of `Node`s. It defines the overall path and manages the transitions between nodes.

*   `start(startNode)`: Sets the initial node for the flow. (Note: In practice, you often pass the start node directly to the `Flow` constructor for conciseness).
*   `_orch(shared, params)` / `_orchAsync(shared, params)`: Internal methods used to run the flow, especially when passing initial parameters to the starting node. For most use cases, `flow.run(sharedState)` or `await flow.runAsync(sharedState)` is sufficient.

**Batch Flows (`BatchFlow`, `AsyncBatchFlow`, `AsyncParallelBatchFlow`)**
These specialized flows are designed to process collections of items. They run a sub-flow for each item in the batch. `AsyncParallelBatchFlow` is particularly useful for concurrently processing batch items, significantly speeding up operations.
