# 2025 1M Plan

## Overview
- **Goal**: $1,000,000 by end 2025.
- **Start capital**: $3.
- **Skills**: coding + gambling.
- **Location**: Kenya.
- **Network**: friends.

## Phase 1 (Months 1‑3)
1. **Set up a small VPS** (e.g., DigitalOcean $5/month).
2. **Learn** Python, blockchain APIs, and Discord bot basics.
3. **Build a simple Discord betting helper** and register a small payment gateway (PayPal/Stripe).
4. **Open a crypto wallet** and create accounts on reputable exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, local Kenya exchanges).

## Phase 2 (Months 4‑8)
1. **Deploy a crypto arbitrage script** that scans price differences across at least three exchanges.
2. **Create a low‑risk, high‑frequency betting bot** for skill‑based dice games, keeping bankroll <5% of total assets.
3. **Pitch revenue sharing to friends**, turning the micro‑app into a small club.

## Phase 3 (Months 9‑12)
1. **Launch a paid subscription app** with real‑time odds and push notifications.
2. **Partner with local artists to mint NFTs** used as staking collateral, earning royalties.
3. **Prepare a micro‑investment deck** for friends and local angel investors using a simple convertible note.

## Risk Mitigation
- **Regulatory**: Monitor Kenya’s evolving crypto gambling laws.
- **Technical**: Test bots in simulated mode before live use; maintain backups.
- **Market**: Diversify across exchanges and stablecoins.
- **Reputational**: Transparent reporting and community updates.

## Crash Game Strategy (Aviator) – Phase 2.5

1. **Automated Aviator Bot**
   - Use the Aviator public API (or web scraping with Selenium) to place bets at the earliest possible moment.
   - Implement an exponential‑i wealth management rule: bet 5–10 % of the current bankroll on a multiplier of 2 × (risk‑heavy).
   - Immediately cash out if the multiplier reaches the target or if the stop‑loss threshold (e.g., 0.8 ×) is hit.

2. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Collect thousands of past Aviator games to build a probability model of when crashes tend to occur.
   - Use a simple Bayesian update to adjust the expected multiplier each round based on real‑time crash data.

3. **Risk‑Controlled Scaling**
   - Start with a modest bet (e.g., $0.10) to test the bot on a paper‑trading sandbox.
   - Gradually increase stake while keeping the bankroll ratio below 10 %.

4. **Revenue Share with Friends**
   - Offer a small fee (e.g., 10 %) on any profits by the bot for the friend‑network group. This creates a steady revenue stream while sharing risk.

5. **Compliance & Transparency**
   - Log every bet, win, and loss to a public spreadsheet for trust building.
   - Be mindful of local gambling regulations and ensure the bot is compliant with Kenya's gaming laws.
